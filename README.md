# Go Programming Language

## Why did you choose this subject?
It was actually one of the first languages I heard about when my interest in coding began.

## How were you first made aware of it?
I became aware of Go while looking into courses on Udemy and reading articles about popular programming languages.

## What problem does it solve?
Go was designed to address the challenges of building scalable, efficient, and concurrent software systems. It aims to provide a simple language with built-in support, making it suitable for building high-performance and scalable applications.

## How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Go provides lightweight goroutines for concurrency, a garbage collector for memory management, a simple and expressive syntax, and a standard library that includes packages for various purposes.

## Why does one use it?
As stated previously, Go is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.

## What are the alternatives?
Some alternatives to Go include Rust, Python, Java, and C++.

## What is it similar to, if anything?
Go is often compared to the C programming language.

## What is the history of this technology?
The initial design work on Go started in 2007, and it was officially announced to the public in 2009.

## Who built it and why?
Go was built by a team of engineers at Google, including Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. They wanted to create a language that addressed the challenges faced by developers at Google when working on large-scale systems, including compile times, scalability, and concurrency.

## Who is maintaining it?
The Go team at Google maintains the language. The Go project is hosted on GitHub, where contributors can participate in its development and ask questions.

## What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
After building something with Go, I find it to be a simple language. However, I would love to use it for a larger-scale project to explore its capabilities further.

## What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
Installing and setting up Go was the only hurdle I encountered since it was something new to me.

## What resources do you recommend for interested students?
- The Go Tour: A great reference available for free on the Go website. It's an excellent place to start learning.
- The Go subreddit (r/golang): An active community where you can find discussions, questions, and resources related to Go.
- Go website (golang.org)

## What are 3 interview questions one might be asked about this technology?
1. What are some advantages of using Go over other programming languages?
2. How does Go handle concurrency, and what are goroutines and channels?
3. Can you explain Go's approach to error handling and its use of multiple return values?
